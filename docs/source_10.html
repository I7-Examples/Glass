<font color=#404040>[Because most of what goes on here is conversation rather than interaction with objects, our setting is quite simple and most of it consists of the characters:</font>]
<br>

<br>
Stage is a room.  
<br>

<br>
The old lady is a woman in the Stage. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>mother</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>stepmother</font>&quot; as the old lady.  The old lady is active. The description of the lady is &quot;<font color=#000080>She looks plucked: thin neck with folds of skin exposed, nose beaky, lips white. Perhaps when her fortunes are mended her cosmetics too will improve.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The Prince is a man in the Stage. The description of the prince is &quot;<font color=#000080>He's tolerably attractive, in his flightless way. It's hard not to pity him a little.</font>&quot; The prince carries a glass slipper. The glass slipper is wearable. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>shoe</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>heel</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>toe</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>foot</font>&quot; as the slipper. The description of the slipper is &quot;<font color=#000080>It is very small for an adult woman's foot.</font>&quot; 
<br>

<br>
Lucy and Theodora are women in the Stage. The printed name of Lucy is &quot;<font color=#000080>Lucinda</font>&quot;. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>Lucinda</font>&quot; as Lucy. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>Theo</font>&quot; as Theodora.<font color=#404040><sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup></font>  The description of Theodora is &quot;<font color=#000080>Soft, round, in every sense yielding: she eats too many candied almonds herself, but never grudges sharing them. No character worth mentioning.</font>&quot; The description of Lucy is &quot;<font color=#000080>More compact than Theodora, and with more self-control.</font>&quot; 
<br>

<br>
The sofa is scenery in the stage. It is an enterable supporter. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>They never let you stand on it.</font>&quot; Some pillows are on the sofa. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>pillow</font>&quot; as the pillows. The description of the pillows is &quot;<font color=#000080>Not as pretty as you.</font>&quot; The pillows are scenery.
<br>

<br>
The wing chair is scenery in the stage. It is an enterable supporter. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>Pitiful wings, really.</font>&quot; Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>wingchair</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>seat</font>&quot; as the chair.
<br>

<br>
Instead of doing anything other than examining when the noun is a thing and the noun is scenery: say &quot;<font color=#000080>That would not help matters, even if you could reach.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The perch is in the stage. It is scenery. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>It's adequately comfortable for your purposes.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of doing something other than examining to the slipper: say &quot;<font color=#000080>It's not yours.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Before wearing the slipper: say &quot;<font color=#000080>There is no part of your body on which that slipper would fit.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<A name="note1"><font color=#404040>[1].  The complication here is that we have both a person object and a subject object for each of these, and we want to avoid overlapping names.</font><p>
