Fitting is a scene. Fitting begins when Wondering ends. When Fitting begins: change conversation set to Table of Fitting Remarks; change the target subject to Theo; now marriage suggests Theo; change the current action to &quot;<font color=#000080>Nervously</font>&quot;.

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He blushes. 'She left it on the stairs; I thought it was the only thing I was going to have left of her.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Mm. Love.' She smiles at him. 'I do wish your mother were alive.'</font>&quot;
<br>
shoe ball &quot;<font color=#000080>'That was a good ball,' says Theodora, out of nowhere. 'It was the nicest ball I've ever been to.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The Prince chuckles. 'Me too,' he says. 'Oddly.'</font>&quot;
<br>
blank stepmother &quot;<font color=#000080>The old lady starts. 'That is a good point,' she says. 'For a bird. Are you intending to interview the older ladies as well? Oh, I don't mean myself, of course!' She manages an almost natural laugh. 'But how do you know that your intended is a young lady?' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The prince looks thunderstruck.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'She might be anyone -- my friend Lady Carpwell for instance--'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I'm sure she was a young woman,' he says firmly, gathering strength again. 'There were references in her conversation that -- things she said which --'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Naturally, if truthful.'</font>&quot;
<br>
blank Theo &quot;<font color=#000080>[if mentioning Theodora]Theodora blushes. 'Stupid bird,' she says. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Must start somewhere,' says the Prince, shrugging. [otherwise]Theodora leans closer to the Prince. [end if]'I can go first, if you want,' she says. Without any shyness, she lifts her skirt slightly and slips her feet out of her afternoon slippers, wiggling her feet on the soft carpet.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'So strange,' she says, giggling. 'Taking off my shoes in the presence of a man!'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I won't tell anyone,' the Prince assures her. </font>&quot;
<br>
blank Lucinda &quot;<font color=#000080>[if mentioning Lucinda]'Might as well start there as anywhere,' says the Prince, shrugging. [otherwise]The Prince licks his lips. [end if]'Miss Lucinda, would you mind trying the slipper? You needn't -- that is, please do not regard this in the nature of a royal request, if you would rather not.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The old lady catches Lucinda's eye, and jerks her head slightly: a command.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'It would be a pleasure,' Lucinda says, though her eyes cloud a little as the Prince kneels at her feet and begins to untie the laces of her boot. Theodora watches the proceedings curiously. </font>&quot;
<br>
ball magic &quot;<font color=#000080>[if mentioning magic]The Prince's eye goes to you. 'Your bird, madam, is freakishly percipient. Positively unnatural.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Yes,' she says. 'Though I promise you it arrived in that condition and was not made so by anyone in this house.' She sighs. [end if]'You are in a difficult situation,' says the old lady. 'You are too intelligent not to have considered the problem thoroughly, and all the risks involved in choosing someone under those circumstances.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Lucinda's lips tighten. 'Magic is abhorrent to God,' she says.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'That is certainly the opinion of some,' the old lady agrees. 'I myself wonder whether He would have encompassed in His creation any power which He considered wholly evil. But that is a private philosophy, and does not excuse a violation of the law.' She glances at the Prince. 'Forgive me: I stray from your problem.'</font>&quot;
<br>
magic shoe &quot;<font color=#000080>'Perhaps the shoe itself is--' begins Theo thoughtfully. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Lucinda scoots a little way from the pillow.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'It hasn't done anything magical,' comments the prince, frowning at the slipper in his hands.</font>&quot;
<br>
magic birds &quot;<font color=#000080>All eyes turn to you. 'I have heard,' the Prince says tentatively, 'about creatures who are possessed...' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The old lady makes a face. 'But what demon would desire to possess a household bird?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The Prince frowns, as though he feels the logic is flawed but can't quite find the point of his objection.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank magic &quot;<font color=#000080>'The creature gets redundant,' says the old lady. 'I'm afraid it has a taste for melodrama.'</font>&quot;
<br>
magic ball &quot;<font color=#000080>'I have considered the problem,' says the Prince. 'Very closely. I have not been able to sleep for considering it.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Do you know,' asks the old lady, 'why she...?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The Prince shakes his head. 'Until she fled I had no hint that she was not simply as she appeared.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Extraordinarily beautiful, no doubt,' remarks the old lady, with a hint of a curling smile; and Lucinda titters.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'And kind, and wise,' the Prince replies, refusing to be drawn. 'Do you know whether magic can counterfeit those qualities as well?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Wisdom rarely and kindness never at all,' says the old lady.</font>&quot;
<br>
ball marriage &quot;<font color=#000080>'Maybe,' Lucinda suggests, 'she thought it would be wrong to deceive you about what she was, and chose this way to, to make it known.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>A spark of comprehension comes into Theo's eyes. 'Yes,' she says. 'She might have thought that-- I mean, I can imagine...'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The old lady glares at her. The Prince looks back and forth, confused.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank marriage &quot;<font color=#000080>'It seems to me,' says the old lady, after a long thoughtful moment, 'that you have no choice but to try this shoe on every eligible young woman, and determine who she was. And if I were you, I would also invent an explanation for this extraordinary method of bride-selection that will satisfy the people at large.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He chuckles, but nods.</font>&quot;
<br>
marriage shoe &quot;<font color=#000080>'Yes, the shoe,' says Lucinda to you; and to her mother: 'Do you think we could send it back to bird school?' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'It knows far too much already and requires no further education,' snaps the old lady.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank love &quot;<font color=#000080>'Are you sure that it wasn't just an infatuation?' the old lady asks gently. 'Such a short acquaintance-- forgive me, but you've always seemed so level-headed.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The Prince smiles without humor. 'I would have said the same. But after meeting her, I am... very sure. It's strange that this is possible, I know.'</font>&quot;
<br>
blank magic &quot;<font color=#000080>'Do you agree with your father's views?' asks Theodora. 'On magic, I mean.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I have not had an opportunity to study his reasoning,' says the Prince, stiffly. 'And in any case it is not for me to challenge his laws.'</font>&quot;
