So we will define some conversation topics, called &quot;subjects&quot;, and also provide tables of what may be said in moving from one subject to the next.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">The player is allowed to try to move from any subject to any other, but non-player characters -- the other people in the room -- will only make conversational connections that &quot;make sense&quot;: subjects that suggest related subjects. So we define a suggestion relation to connect one subject to others. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">Non-player characters are also trying to reach specific conversation outcomes, so they will seek the best path from the current subject to their goal subject, and keep the conversation moving in that direction.

<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>.  This is just a marker to keep track of whether the old lady (or any of the others) have already spoken during a turn; if so, we don't want them moving the dialogue on their own. One of my discoveries in previous conversation games is that it is usually best to limit non-player characters to one piece of dialogue behavior per turn -- either responding to something the player said OR advancing an idea of their own. If one allows them to do both, the conversation is controlled primarily by the game rather than the player, and many players find this frustrating.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  This rule reactivates the old lady each turn, but after the spontaneous speaking rule above has already been tried.</span></p>
<p><a name="note3"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note3ref">[3]</a>.  A phrase provided by the foregoing extension, which removes all quotation marks, exclamation points, and question marks from input before attempting to parse</span></p>
<p><a name="note4"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note4ref">[4]</a>.  We have more or less preserved Inform's default understanding of obscenity, though testers tried a range of other interesting words.</span></p>
<p><a name="note5"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note5ref">[5]</a>.  The complication here is that we have both a person object and a subject object for each of these, and we want to avoid overlapping names.</span></p>
<p><a name="note6"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note6ref">[6]</a>.  This bit of conversation might conventionally have gone before the banner in a When play begins... passage; but since we have no room descriptions in this game, this would mean having a banner immediately followed by a command prompt. So I decided instead to go with a null prologue and put this bit of  chat after the banner but before the command prompt.</span></p>
<p><a name="note7"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note7ref">[7]</a>.  It is important to humor one's testers.</span></p>
