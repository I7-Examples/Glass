Wondering is a scene. Wondering begins when Prologue ends. When Wondering begins: change conversation set to Table of Wondering Remarks; change the target subject to ball; change the current action to &quot;<font color=#000080>Curiously</font>&quot;.

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'It's fortunate she left behind such a distinctive token,' says the old lady, her eyebrows raised in mischief.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank magic &quot;<font color=#000080>Unless you are mistaken, the old lady flinches.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank Theodora &quot;<font color=#000080>Theodora starts. 'I didn't have anything to do with it,' she remarks. 'That is--' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'That's enough, Theo,' says the old lady. 'No one said that you did.'</font>&quot;
<br>
blank Lucinda &quot;<font color=#000080>'Yes, Parrot?' asks Lucinda, looking up at you rather coldly. She's always made it clear she thinks you possessed. Theo is much nicer.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank heirs &quot;<font color=#000080>'And I suppose this is a suitable young woman for -- that is, your father will think her a good mother to his grandchildren?' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I'm sure she comes of good family,' says the Prince. 'Everything about her spoke of breeding.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The old lady exchanges a glance with Lucinda; two little smiles of quiet smugness, even if they neither of them would like to say why.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Very appropriate,' says the old lady.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank marriage &quot;<font color=#000080>'It's marvelous that you were so drawn to a young lady that you want to marry her even though you can't remember what she looks like,' remarks the old woman. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The Prince glances at her sidelong, but she does not meet his eye.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'She was very pretty.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'As you recall,' the old lady says.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Yes, as I recall,' he says. 'I wrote down some notes at the end of the evening. Everything I could remember about her, everything I recalled her saying to me. I believe I noted that she was pretty.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The old lady casts about for something to say to that.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank love &quot;<font color=#000080>'Do you--' begins the old lady. 'Oh, dear, this is such a delicate question, and there is no tactful way to put it. Do you have reason to think she reciprocates your regard?' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Mama, he's the Prince!' exclaims Theo, looking scandalized.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I know, dear,' says the old lady. 'But it is possible that she does not feel the same way he does, and one-sided love-matches are worse, I think, than marriages of pure convenience on both sides.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The Prince's cheeks go a little pink. 'She told me-- that is, she put it very delicately, but she gave the impression that she had admired me for some time.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Ah,' says the old lady.</font>&quot;
<br>
love marriage &quot;<font color=#000080>'If she does love you,' Lucinda says, 'I wonder why she was not more straightforward? Deception has no part in true love.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The old lady shoots her a look of the uttermost exasperation. 'You're very young,' she says. 'Leave the platitudes and generalities to those who have seen a little more of the world.'</font>&quot;
<br>
marriage stepmother &quot;<font color=#000080>'I was so fortunate in my own alliances,' says the old lady, startled into a reminiscent mood. 'The dear captain -- Lucinda and Theodora's father -- was so handsome! and then...' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>She trails off before mentioning that her second husband was so rich and socially prominent. There is a tactful silence.</font>&quot;
<br>
blank ball &quot;<font color=#000080>'It wasn't a masked ball,' the old lady says. 'It wasn't even badly lit. Your father did not stint on the candles at all.' 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The Prince opens his mouth.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Oh, dear, dear, I am being odiously prying. I'm so sorry. Perhaps you met this young lady out on the terrace...' She trails off, suggesting the very faintest disapproval of young ladies who linger on terraces, out of sight of chaperones, to hold conversations with Princes, and never tell their names.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I met her in candlelight,' says the Prince, goaded. 'But she left me at midnight.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The effect of this comment is like the shattering of glass: for a moment you wonder if he dropped the shoe...? No. It is merely that he has admitted, or near-as-admitted, that his chosen bride is one who appeared to him under a glamor, a magical enchantment. A crime punishable by death under his father's law.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Everyone remains very very quiet.</font>&quot; 
<br>

<br>

<br>
Wondering ends when the current subject is the ball.
